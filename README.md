# 8bitMusicCodeGenerator
This is program is a Java program that used to generate the C code for playing 8 bit music on Arduino board with a transducer.



# Deployment:
1.Need to download avr-gcc compiler first for using the Arduino Board.
The avr-gcc software can be downloaded from http://sourceforge.net/projects/winavr/. 

2.Connecting to the Arduino Board:
Connect the transducer the the PB4(Port B, bit 4).
If an LCD shield is connected to the Arduino then find the correspoding port which connects to PB4.

# Note:
The program currently only supports:
Whole notes, half notes, quarter notes, eighth notes, sixteenth notes, rests.
Updates will be made in the future.
